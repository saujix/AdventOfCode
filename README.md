# Advent of Code ü§†
  Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar.It has been running since 2015.

## History about this i found on wikipedia.
  Advent of Code was created by Wastl, who is still the sole maintainer of the project.
  The event was initially launched on December 1, 2015. By midnight EST (UTC‚àí05:00), 81 people had signed up for the event, going slightly over Wastl's planned 70-participant capacity. Within 12 hours, about 4,000 people had joined, nearly causing a system crash. After 48 hours, there were about 15,000 people, and by the end of the 2015 event, the total had risen to 52,000.
